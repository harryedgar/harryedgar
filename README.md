- I'm currently working on my INF 370 Capstone project
    - Where my team and myself are developing a Project Management and Resource Allocation System with key features including Leave, Project,
      Resource, Timesheet, and Employee Management. Our main goal is to integrate the Leave and Timesheet components to synchronize seamlessly,
      ensuring that once leave is taken, it is promptly reflected on the user's timesheet.
